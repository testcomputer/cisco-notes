The majority of networking troubleshooting is done in the bottom 4 layers

Ethernet equipment. Standard


Illustrate the hierarchical network design model and architecture using the access, distribution, and core layers
Compare and contrast the various hardware and software switching mechanisms and operation, while defining the Ternary Content
Addressable Memory (TCAM) and Content Addressable Memory (CAM), along with process switching, fast switching, and Cisco Express Forwarding concepts



Troubleshoot Layer 2 connectivity using VLANs and trunking
Implementation of redundant switched networks using Spanning Tree Protocol
Troubleshooting link aggregation using Etherchannel


Run ping to verify the network is live. 
Run a network stress test to connect the system

Layer 2 Address = MAC address
Layer 3 address = IP address


Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is used to transfer webpages over the Internet.
• File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is used to transfer files over a network.
• Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is used to transfer files over a network.
• Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is used to assign Internet Protocol (IP) addressing
information to clients.
• Domain Name System (DNS) is used to translate host names to IP addresses.
• Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used to send email messages.
• Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) is used to receive email messages.
• Telnet is used to create a terminal connection to remote devices.
• Secure Shell (SSH) is used to create a secure remote terminal connection to a networked device.
